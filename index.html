Hi everyone.

I'm using fluent-agent-hydra to send nginx access and error logs to EFK stack. It's successfully sending data and output
goes to elasticsearch however I cannot parse the log properly.

My nginx access log example:

219.85.178.198 - - [05/Jan/2016:11:03:36 +0800] "GET /api/v1/blabla?page=1&mode=all&condition=latest HTTP/1.1" 200 800
"https://blabla.cc/wiki" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/47.0.2526.106 Safari/537.36"

error log:

2016/01/05 10:54:35 [error] 20863#0: *101644 open() "/home/blabla/blabla_statics/uploads/1102_1.jpg" failed (2: No such
file or directory), client: 118.163.71.51, server: blabla.cc, request: "GET /uploads/1102_1.jpg HTTP/1.1", host:
"miir.cc", referrer: "http://blabla.local/discovery/list/1102"

td-agent conf:

<source>
@type forward
port 24224
format /^(?<remote>[^ ]*) (?<host>[^ ]*) (?<user>[^ ]*) \[(?<time>[^\]]*)\] [^ ]* "(?<method>\S+)(?: +(?<path>[^\"]*)
                        +\S*)?" (?<code>[^ ]*) (?<size>[^ ]*)(?: "(?<referer>[^\"]*)" "(?<agent>[^\"]*)")?$/
 time_format %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z/
</source>

the problem is it cannot parse correctly. Also another question that I have is how can I also parse error logs? do I need to add another <source> field on my td-agent conf file? 

Thanks.
